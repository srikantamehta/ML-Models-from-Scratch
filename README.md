Author: Srikanta Mehta \

## Description

This repository implements several machine learning algorihtms from scratch: 
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Edited K-Nearest Neighbors
- Condensed K-Nearest Neighbors. 
- Feedforward Neural Networks
- Autoencoders
- Value Iteration
- Q Learning

## Project Structure

This project has several directories:

- `data_configs/` - Configuration file that contains configs for each dataset, specifying parameters for processing.
- `datasets/` - This directory contains the datasets used in the experiments, along with their respective `.names` files which describe the dataset attributes.
- `models/` - Contains the implementations of the ML models and a null model for baseline comparison.
- `src/` - The source code for the project, including modules for data preprocessing, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics.
- `experiments/` - Contains experiments on each model and evalauations of performance. 
- `reports/` - Contains reports written evaluating each model.
