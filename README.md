## Description

This project develops and evaluates three distinct types of neural network models: Linear Models, Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNs), and Autoencoder-Enhanced Networks. Each model is applied to various machine learning tasks involving both classification and regression, using datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The objective is to compare the performance of these models in different settings, particularly focusing on their ability to handle non-linear relationships and high-dimensional data, and to determine how model complexity influences their predictive accuracy.

## Project Structure

This project has several directories:

- `configs/` - Configuration file that contains configs for each dataset, specifying parameters for processing.
- `datasets/` - This directory contains the datasets used in the experiments, along with their respective `.names` files which describe the dataset attributes.
- `models/` - Contains the implementation of the neural networks and linear models (neural_networks.py).
- `src/` - The source code for the project, including modules for data preprocessing, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics.
