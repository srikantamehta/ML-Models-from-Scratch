## Description

This project implements the decision tree algorithm for regression and classification tasks as well as a reduced error pruning method. 

## Project Structure

This project has several directories:

- `configs/` - Configuration file that contains configs for each dataset, specifying parameters for processing.
- `datasets/` - This directory contains the datasets used in the experiments, along with their respective `.names` files which describe the dataset attributes.
- `models/` - Contains the implementation of the decision tree and other models such as the null model for baseline comparison.
- `src/` - The source code for the project, including modules for data preprocessing, cross-validation, and evaluation metrics.
